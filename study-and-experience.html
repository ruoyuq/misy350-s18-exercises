    <h2>Study and Experience</h2>
    <p>I am studying in University of Delaware now. My majors are Accounting<br/>
       and MIS. I am a Junior, and i love helping others.
        <p>My friends and I applied the International Volunteer Organization's<br/>
           program in Peru, and we went there last summer.We lived in a volunteer<br/>
           house, which is provided by local family. Although life here was not as<br/>
           comfortable as we were at home, but every person was kind and enthusiastic,
           <br/>also we believe we are doing the meaningful and amazing things.<br>
